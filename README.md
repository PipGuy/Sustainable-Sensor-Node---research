# Sustainable-Sensor-Node---research

This is a little project that i made for my thesis. It uses ESP32 as it's main MCU and 2 INA219 for measuring the voltage, current, and power from an energy source (preferablly solar panel) and from battery to the sensor node

The schematic looks something like this, with also attached a 2D picture for better visualization
